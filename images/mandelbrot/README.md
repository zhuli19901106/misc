# Mandelbrot Fractal
[Mandelbrot Fractal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_fractal)

These are selections of a series of zooming snapshots from a toy program that I wrote a few years back.

It tried to zoom into the Mandelbrot Fractal until the computation took too long or precision failed.

Of course, the coloring scheme was customizable, it didn't matter anymore.

I lost the code long before, but I kept the image as my LinkedIn profile cover.

It reminds me of the day when I'm free to <b>meditate and pursue knowledge and wisdom.</b>

The beauty lies within the seemingly recurring deja vu, while the infinite variation never ends.
